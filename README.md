# Project: Delivery Rush (A JAVAFXGL Platormer Game)

## Description of the Project:
- Delivery Rush is a 2D platformer game, but with a modern twist: players take on the role of delivery riders racing against time to deliver parcels. In each level, the rider must navigate through a bustling city filled with hazards, from speeding cars and treacherous potholes to mischievous pedestrians and unpredictable weather. The goal? Deliver all assigned parcels within the time limit, or risk getting fired!

- As the game progresses, obstacles change based on the weather conditions. On sunny days, players must dodge traffic and construction zones, while rainy levels bring slippery roads, deep puddles, and reduced visibility. In stormy weather, powerful winds may push the rider off course, and in snow-covered levels, icy patches and snowdrifts slow down progress. The dynamic weather system ensures that no two levels feel the same, requiring players to adapt their strategies to each unique challenge. Missing a delivery or failing to complete the route on time will cost the player points, and too many failures will end their run.

- The ultimate goal is to become the cityâ€™s fastest and most reliable delivery rider, unlocking new neighborhoods as they go!
