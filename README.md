# Project: Delivery Rush (A JAVAFXGL Platormer Game)

## Description of the Project:
- Delivery Rush is a 2D platformer game, but with a modern twist: players take on the role of delivery riders racing against time to deliver parcels. In each level, the rider must navigate through carefully designed levels that can pose a challenge to players. The goal? Deliver parcels within the time limit, or risk getting fired! As the game progresses, levels become harder to complete. The ultimate goal is to become the cityâ€™s fastest and most reliable delivery rider!
